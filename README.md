This repo contains "a" version of my "Visualizing Connections" presentation. It's definitely less interesting than the one I have locally, because I had to change some of the interactive slides to (ugly) videos, since this included client code. But I hope that these slides will at least give you an reminder of tha talk (I think the slides only make sense once you seen it, there's basically no text or explanation on them, just visuals and screenshots ;) )
